        Hey there! I'm Tejaswa Dayal, an experienced (1.6yrs) software developer
        with a passion for turning ideas into reality. With a Master's degree in
        Computer Applications from G.L. Bajaj Institute of Technology &
        Management, I've honed my skills in Python, JavaScript, Django, React,
        Next.js, and TailwindCSS. My journey in the tech world has been nothing
        short of an exciting adventure.
        <br />
        <br />
        I thrive on creating secure, high-performing, and user-friendly
        applications. My superpowers include teamwork communication,
        adaptability, leadership, and problem-solving. Whether it's building
        interactive user interfaces or developing robust backend systems, I love
        tackling challenges head-on and delivering top-notch solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me exploring the latest
        tech trends, brainstorming the next big project, or playing a new video
        game. I love connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and collaborating
        on innovative ideas. Curious to see more of my work or get in touch?

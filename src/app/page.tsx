      Hey there! I'm Tejaswa Dayal, a software developer with a passion for turning ideas into reality. With a Master's degree in Computer Applications from G.L. Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management, I've mastered the art of coding in Python, JavaScript, Django, React, Nextjs and TailwindCSS. My journey in the tech world has been nothing short of an exciting adventure.

At WebKolek, I was the go-to person for building awesome features for web applications. I created engaging referral systems and interactive quiz modules for an EdTech platform (<a href="" className="text-primary-icon cursor-pointer">Prameyshala</a>) and even developed a real estate website with user authentication and an admin dashboard. It was a blast bringing these projects to life!

My time at Echo Managed Services was like being a tech wizard. I developed SOAP endpoints, ensured smooth communication between systems, and achieved 100% coverage in MUnit tests. Writing detailed documentation and developing Proof of Concepts (POCs) were all part of the fun!
<br />
<br />
I thrive on creating secure, high-performing, and user-friendly applications. My superpowers include teamwork, communication, adaptability, leadership, and problem-solving. I'm always eager to learn new things and take on exciting challenges.
<br />

When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me exploring the latest tech trends, brainstorming the next big project, or playing a new video game. I love connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and collaborating on innovative ideas. Curious to see more of my work or get in touch?
